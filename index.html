        <h2>Hello and welcome to my page</h2>
        <p class="summary">Growing up in a small town in Brazil, I faced many challenges and overcame them through
            hard work and determination. From selling sandwiches with my grandmother at a young age to taking on my
            first job at a pharmacy at just 12 years old, I always found ways to push myself and succeed.</p>

        <p class="summary">
            But my journey hasn't been all about work. I also made sure to use my skills and knowledge to give back to
            my community, such as teaching computer skills to younger students at my school. This desire to help
            others has continued throughout my career, as I have volunteered in a psychiatric hospital and rescued two
            cats in need.</p>

        <p class="summary">Despite feeling isolated at times, I never let that hold me back. I learned English at a
            young age and
            always looked for ways to improve myself and my circumstances. This drive eventually led me to make the
            bold decision to move to Dubai in 2011, where I found new opportunities and a fresh start.</p>

        <p class="summary"> With a passion for technology and a drive to constantly improve processes, I have ventured
            into the world
            of Software Engineering. In addition to my formal education, I am currently taking on complementary
            coursework in areas such as Python programming, web development, iOS development, and AWS cloud. My
            background in operations and key account management has honed my skills in optimizing performance and
            driving growth. I have a proven track record of building and leading high-performing teams, as well as
            developing and implementing successful training programs to upskill employees and ensure their alignment
            with organizational goals. I excel at problem-solving and strategizing, and have a talent for forging
            strong relationships and effectively communicating with a diverse range of professionals. Fluent in
            Portuguese and English, able to communicate in Spanish, and basic knowledge of French, I am well-equipped
            to navigate a variety of cultural environments.
