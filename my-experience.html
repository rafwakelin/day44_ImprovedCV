        <h2 class="edu-skills">Volunteering Experience</h2>
        <div class="skill-row">
            <p class="summary">
                Growing up, volunteering was always an important part of my life. I spent a lot of time at my church,
                Perfect Liberty, where I participated in a variety of activities to give back to my community. One of my
                favorite things to do was to organize "campanhas do agasalho," or clothing drives, during the winter
                months to collect clothes for those in need. I also organized "campanhas do alimento," or food drives,
                during times of economic hardship to help alleviate hunger. In addition to these efforts, I also
                participated in city clean ups, where we would sweep the streets and collect trash to keep our community
                looking clean and beautiful. I even helped to organize Yakissoba and Pastel nights to raise funds for
                the maintenance of our church.</p>
            <p class="summary">
                In my eighth grade year of elementary school, I had the opportunity to volunteer at my public school,
                where I was responsible for the computer lab. I taught my peers how to use computers and productivity
                software like the Microsoft Office suite. While most of the kids only attended the classes to play
                games, I was happy to be able to contribute something positive to their lives.
                In college, I continued to volunteer in a variety of projects. I participated in an art project to bring
                culture to underprivileged people, and I even joined a ballet dance group as the first dancer. I
                organized events for the citizens of a mental institution, providing entertainment and food for those in
                need. I also participated in presentations in my city and clean ups in protected forests, working to
                remove plastic from the environment.</p>
            <p class="summary">
                After moving to Dubai, I became particularly concerned about the plight of stray cats in the area. I
                rescued two stray cats in need, Maya and Pandora, and gave them a home with me. I also contributed
                financially to vet treatments for other stray cats that I couldn't take in myself, and I frequently take
                sick or injured cats to the vet for treatment. I also make a point of regularly feeding the stray cats
                in my community.</p>
            <p class="summary">
                When I have the time, I also enjoy teaching English to those who are trying to learn the language. I
                wish I had more time to contribute to even more causes and make a greater impact, but it can be
                difficult to balance everything.</p>
            <p class="summary">
                In summary, here are some of the ways I have contributed to my community through volunteering:
            <ul>
                <li>Organized clothing and food drives for those in need</li>
                <li>Participated in city clean ups and fundraising events</li>
                <li>Taught computer skills to my peers</li>
                <li>Participated in an art project to bring culture to underprivileged people</li>
                <li>Organized events for the citizens of a mental institution</li>
                <li>Participated in presentations and clean ups in protected forests</li>
                <li>Rescued and cared for stray cats</li>
                <li>Taught English to those learning the language</li>
            </ul>
